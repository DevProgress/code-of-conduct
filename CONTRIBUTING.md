## Welcome!

We're so glad you're thinking about contributing to the DevProgress Code of Conduct! If you're unsure or afraid of anything, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contribution, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Before contributing, we encourage you to read our CONTRIBUTING policy (you are here), our LICENSE, and our README, all of which should be in this repository. If you have any questions, [codeofconduct@devprogress.org](mailto:codeofconduct@DevProgress.org).

## Public domain

This code of conduct is in the public domain within the United States, and copyright and related rights in the work worldwide are waived through the [CC0 1.0 Universal public domain dedication](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

All contributions to this code of conduct will be released under the CC0 dedication. By submitting a pull request, you are agreeing to comply with this waiver of copyright interest.

## Requesting Changes:

Our pull request/merging process is designed to give the DevProgress team and others in our spaces a chance to consider and discuss any changes to this policy. This policy affects all DevProgress spaces, both online and off, and everyone in those spaces is expected to uphold it.

#### Open an issue on the repository

If you don't have specific language to submit but you have a change to suggest or a concern you would like addressed, you are welcome to open an issue on this repository. Members of the DevProgress team will respond as soon as they can.

#### Submit A Pull Request

If you have specific language to contribute, please submit a pull request.

In order for us to merge a pull request, it must:

- Be at least seven days old. Pull Requests may be held longer if necessary to give people a reasonable chance to weigh in.
- Receive a +1 from a majority of the members of the code of conduct working group who have opted into the conversation about it.

If there is significant dissent from within DevProgress, a meeting will be held to discuss it before any action is taken on the pull request.
